Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
If you think that Maven could help your project, you can find out more information in the "About Maven" section of the navigation. This includes an in-depth description of what Maven is and a list of some of its main features.

This site is separated into the following sections, depending on how you'd like to use Maven:

Use	Download, Install, Run Maven	Configure, Use Maven and Maven Plugins
Information for those needing to build a project that uses Maven	Information for developers using Maven to build their project, including a "10 minute test" that gives a practical overview of Maven's main features and a plugin list for more information on each plugin.
Extend	Write Maven Plugins	Improve the Maven Central Repository
Information for developers writing Maven plugins.	Information for those who may or may not use Maven, but are interested in getting project metadata into the central repository.
Contribute	Help Maven	Develop Maven
Information if you'd like to get involved. Maven is an open source community and welcomes contributions.	Information for those who are currently Maven developers, or who are interested in contributing to the Maven project itself.
Each guide is divided into a number of trails to get you started on a particular topic, and includes a reference area and a "cookbook" of common examples.

You can access the guides at any time from the left navigation. If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the documentation index.
